## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### TPT Filter Implementation

MALIBU uses advanced TPT (Topology-Preserving Transform) state variable filters to achieve different slopes:

- **12dB/octave (2-pole)**: Single TPT-SVF stage
- **24dB/octave (4-pole)**: Two cascaded TPT-SVF stages  
- **48dB/octave (8-pole)**: Four cascaded TPT-SVF stages

Each filter stage implements the TPT zero-delay feedback topology:
```
u = (input - R * s1 - s2) * h
v1 = u * g
v2 = v1 + s1
v3 = v2 * g + s2
```

### Key Components

1. **TPTFilterProcessor**: Advanced zero-delay feedback filter engine with saturation
2. **FrequencyResponseDisplay**: Real-time visualization component with thread-safe communication
3. **SlopeSelector**: Interactive slope selection interface
4. **SaturationTypeSelector**: Saturation algorithm selection interface
5. **PluginProcessor**: JUCE audio processor with parameter management
6. **PluginEditor**: Complete GUI implementation with Malibu-inspired design

### Parameter Management

- **Cutoff Frequency**: 20Hz - 20kHz, logarithmic scaling with sample-accurate smoothing
- **Resonance**: 0.0 - 1.0, linear scaling with geometric Q distribution for multi-stage stability
- **Drive**: 0.0 - 1.0, input gain control for saturation stage
- **Slope Selection**: Discrete choice between 12dB, 24dB, 48dB per octave
- **Saturation Type**: Clean, Warm (Tube), Aggressive algorithms
- **Thread-Safe Communication**: Lock-free FIFO for audio/UI thread separation
5. **PluginEditor**: Complete GUI implementation

### Parameter Management

- **Cutoff Frequency**: 20Hz - 20kHz, logarithmic scaling
- **Resonance**: 0.5 - 10.0, linear scaling (Q factor)

## üîß Development Notes

### Filter Design Principles

The multi-slope implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Stability**: Each filter stage is independently stable
2. **Consistency**: All slopes use the same filter topology
3. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time audio processing
4. **Precision**: High-resolution parameter control

### Performance Characteristics

- **CPU Usage**: Scales linearly with slope selection
- **Latency**: Zero-latency processing (no look-ahead)
- **Memory**: Minimal state per filter stage
- **Precision**: 32-bit floating-point throughout
